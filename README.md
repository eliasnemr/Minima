#### :point_right: Getting Started

At this point you should have all the necessary packages and frameworks.  The following steps will show you how to run the project itself.

:bellhop_bell: *Skip step **1** if you want to manually download the repository*. 

**1.** Open your terminal and clone the repository as shown below:
>``
$ git clone https://github.com/eliasnemr/Minima.git
``



**2.** Open your preferred code editor and _**cd**_ to the top directory where the **_package.json_** is.
>``
$ cd ~/minimacore/mobile-app-front-end/app
``

**3.** Now that you're in the same directory with the **_package.json_**, you can run **_npm's_** package installer
  >``
  $ npm install
  ``

**4.** After all the packages have been installed, you will now be able to launch the app either in
- **Browser**
- **iOS**, _or_
- **Android**

 #### :globe_with_meridians: Browser
To test the app in your browser you will have to have the Minima node running on your local machine.  (If you haven't already downloaded the Minima Node, follow the tutorial [here](www.github.com/spartacusrex99/Minima)).

 Launch the project in your local browser by typing in the terminal

  >``$ ionic serve``

The browser should now automatically launch with the app running locally.  If it doesn't open your browser then just manually browse to your localhost at port 8100; http://localhost:8100/. 

 #### :robot: Android
 To launch the app in an android emulator you must have **Android Studio** installed.

 You launch the android app using
  >``$ npx cap open android``


 #### :iphone: iOS
 To launch the app in iOS you must have a MAC machine and Xcode installed.

 You launch the iOS app using
 >``$ npx cap open ios``
